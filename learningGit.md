# Learning Git

## Personal Notes 

Here's a brief summary of my personal notes about learning Git:
- **Git Commands**: I learned some `git command` to use git in the Terminal.
- **Exercise Goal**: I need to do at least 10 `git commit` to record my changes.

### Git Add
- Use `git add` to add the file before `git commit`.

### Git Commit
- Use `git commit -m ""` to record the changes while editing the file.

### Git Push
- Use `git push` to push the commits to Github.
